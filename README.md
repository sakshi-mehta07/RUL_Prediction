# Cross-Architecture Evaluation and Proposing an Ensemble Method for Jet Engine Remaining Life Prediction Using NASA’s C-MAPSS

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a central task in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), with recent literature increasingly exploring deep learning approaches. While prior work focuses on individual architectures and their specific modeling benefits, we present a systematic comparative study using the NASA C-MAPSS dataset. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we apply rigorous preprocessing including standardization, data augmentation, and piece-wise linear RUL transformation; (2) we evaluate four distinct architectures—Hierarchical Deep Neural Network (HDNN), Autoencoder-BiLSTM, Residual CNN (ResCNN), and Transformers —across all four C-MAPSS subdatasets; (3) we propose an ensemble "supermodel" that integrates variations of the previous architectures, leveraging complementary model characteristics via shared feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that optimal base model performance varies across subdatasets, validating our ensemble strategy. Our supermodel achieves competitive results with an RMSE of 12.7 and score of 257 on FD001. While not always outperforming individual models, the ensemble consistently improves generalization and performance stability across all datasets.
